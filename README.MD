# Poker Simulator

This repo contains a Visual Studio Solution containing 2 different projects with the same functionality: apply Poker rules to determine the winner between two players.

Both projects are .NET 5.0 console applications developed in C# 9.0 and F# 5.0

Please note that while I am a veteran in OOP (mainly C++ and C#), in the last 5 years I have been extensively developing my FP skills. I am an F# advocate.
This is the reason why I have developed the problem in both languages.

Tooling used:

- Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Version 16.8.3
- .NET 5.0 SDK

All the necessary files to build and run the applications are in the solution, including the input file and the PDF problem assignment document:

- Open the solution in Visual Studio
- Select the application to execute (CsPoker or FsPoker)
- Press F5 or Ctrl+F5 (on Windows)
